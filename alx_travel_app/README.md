 Background Jobs for Email Notifications

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This milestone enhances the **`alx_travel_app`** project by introducing **asynchronous background processing** using **Celery** with **RabbitMQ** as the message broker.  
The goal is to offload time-consuming email sending tasks from the main requestâ€“response cycle, improving **performance**, **scalability**, and **user experience**.

---

## ðŸš€ Objectives
- Integrate **Celery** into the Django project.
- Configure **RabbitMQ** as the Celery message broker.
- Set up a **worker process** to handle background tasks.
- Implement **email notification** jobs.
- Ensure that email sending happens **asynchronously** and does **not block** user actions.
- Use **Docker Compose** for environment setup.
